      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The device sits discreetly underneath any car seat, detecting the
        presence of a child and the vehicleâ€™s status. Alerts are sent out to
        primary and secondary contacts, escalating to emergency services if
        needed.
